# Bird and Tortoise - Game Jam

This project was created by me and my brother for a game jam with the theme, "Moving Fortress." The game is a puzzle game based off of the "Sokoban" game genre, which involves the player pushing boxes to certain locations. The premise of the game is that there is a mutualistic relationship between a bird and a giant tortoise, where the bird lives in the trees that grow on the tortoise's back, while the bird finds food for the tortoise in exchange. The gameplay involves the player taking control of the bird and pushing fruits to lead the tortoise the goal.
